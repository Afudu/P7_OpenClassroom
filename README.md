**Student:** Abdoul Baki Seydou

**Date:** 04/04/2023

# Abstract
This project consists of designing for a client, AlgoInvest&Trade, 
an algorithm that will maximize their clientsâ€™ profits after two years of investment, 
an algorithm capable of trying out all the different combinations of shares that fit the constraints, 
and choose the most profit-yielding shares to buy in less than a second. 

# Requirement

Latest version of Python must be installed.

You can download the latest version for your system from : https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Installation

The following commands rely on the knowledge of how to use the terminal (Unix, macOS) or the command line (Windows).

**1 - Get the code**

  * $ git clone https://github.com/Afudu/P7_OpenClassroom.git

**2 - Move to the folder**

  * Unix/macOS/Windows: cd P7_OpenClassroom

**3 - Create a virtual environment**

  * Unix/macOS: $ python3 -m venv pythonenv
  * Windows: py -m venv pythonenv
  
    * Note: you can create the virtual environment in another folder, then move to that folder to run the command above.
    * Example: in the above command, our virtual environment created is called pythonenv - you can give a different name.

**4 - Activate the virtual environment created**

  * Unix/macOS: $ source pythonenv/bin/activate

  * Windows: pythonenv\Scripts\activate

**5 - Securely upgrade pip**

 * Unix/macOS/Windows: pip install --upgrade pip

**6 - Install all dependencies**

 * Unix/macOS/Windows: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the application

To run each of the four scripts, in the terminal (Unix, macOS) or command line (Windows):

python script_file.py

# PEP 8 adherence

The folder 'flake_report' in the repository contains an HTML report generated by flake8-html which displays no errors.
A new report can be generated by running the following command in the terminal (Unix, macOS) 
or command line (Windows): flake8

The file setup.cfg in the root of the repository contains the settings used to generate the report.
